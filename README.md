# Sketch Plugin - CopytoAll

Sketch plugin to copy layers/groups/symbols to all artboards (excpet the on where the original item is already).

# Usage

This plugin will copy the current selected item to all other artboards, and place them exactly at the same spot.
Just navigate to Plugins > CopytoAll or use the keyboard shortcut ```cmd-alt-a```

Once you used it on any item, that item will become the 'master' of that series of copies - so if you will use the ```cmd-alt-a``` again, it will update all copies to the new looks and position of the 'naster'.
This 'smart' connection can be very helpful if you make an artboard and treat it as a master-page for all others.
Otherwise it might get sloppy...
