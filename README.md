# Sketch Plugin - Copy 2 All

Sketch plugin to copy layers/groups/symbols to all artboards, and keep a connection between the original item and it's copies.

# Usage

This plugin will copy the current selected items to all other artboards, and place them exactly at the same spot.
Just navigate to Plugins > Copy 2 All or use the keyboard shortcut ```⌘``` + ```⌥``` + ```a```

Once you used it on any item, that item will become the 'master' of that series of copies - so if you will use the ```⌘``` + ```⌥``` + ```a``` once again, it will update all copies to the new looks and position of the 'master'.
This connection is defined by a suffix (:c2all) that is added automatically to the copied layer name, so you can rename the copies to cancel this connection. BTW - please make sure all your original items on the master artboard have unique names. 

This 'super smart' connection can be very helpful if you make an artboard and treat it as a master page for all others.
Otherwise it might get sloppy...
